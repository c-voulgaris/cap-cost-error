DATA NOTES

1. Where there are multiple names for the same project, it's been included as "(aka ...)". 412 is included in AR97 and 98 but never entered Preliminary Engineering.
2. Section 5309 funding does not include non-New Starts FFGA Commitment funding. Specifically, it does not include Fixed Guideway Modernization which is included in other federal funding.
3. We have captured the estimates when projects enter a milestone, not when estimates change during a milestone.
4. For projects approved into preliminary engineering under SAFETEA-LU, when MAP-21 was adopted, some were considered to be in project development and needed to be approved again in order to enter into preliminary engineering.
5. Cost estimate ranges are averaged.
6. FTA approval of Final Design pending resolution of compliance with the Americans for Disabilities Act is considered to be Final Design.
