,* This project was later folded into MARC Commuter Rail Improvements (Project 404),,,,,,,,
,"** Both of these projects started as LRT proposals, were switched to BRT in the 2008 Annual Report, and then switched back to (and were eventually built as) LRT",,,,,,,,
,"*** The East Corridor and Gold Line were approved into preliminary engineering in April 2009 as
separate projects. Both projects received Records of Decision in November 2009 and approval
to enter final design in April 2010. Because RTD will be managing the East Corridor and Gold
Line as a single project, FTA agreed to consider them for a single Full Funding Grant Agreement
(FFGA) as the Eagle Commuter Rail project. ",,,,,,,,
