# Capital Cost Escalation and Overrun for Federally-funded Fixed-guideway transit

This is a project of Dr Carole Turley Voulgaris, which has been supported by the
following research assistants over the years (listed alphabetically):

* Charuvi Begwani
* Sue Chen
* Alex Cox
* Zoe Iacovino
* Ryan Johnson
* Mojdeh Mahdavi
* Cam McCutchen
* Arnav Murulidhar
* Tianyu Su
* Megan Willis-Jackson

The purpose of this project is to compile a database of projects that have been
funded by the Federal Transit Administrations Capital Improvement Grants program
(section 5309) and how project budgets and timelines have changes over the the
project planning and project construction periods.

## Data sources (ranked by priority; up to January 2024):

* Capital Investment Grant (CIG) Dashboard: https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grants/grant-programs/capital-investments/capital-investment-grant-cig-dashboard 
* Annual Report on Funding Recommendations: https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grant-programs/capital-investments/annual-report-funding-recommendations

### Notes and background

The material in this folder offers background on the project itself as well as on
the history of the data gathering exercise.

* *Eno.pptx:* These are slides from a presentation Dr Voulgaris gave as part of 
the Project Delivery Symposium hosted by the Eno Center for Transportation in 
October 2021. The focus of the presentation was on the relationship between
cost estimation and ridership forecasting and the differences and similarities
between studying bias in each.
* *initial-data-2020.xlsx:* This was an initial data assembly attempt by Mojdeh
Mahdavi and Charuvi Begwani in 2020.
* *Notes on spreadsheets.docx:* This is a word document that describes some of 
the abbreviations that are used in the current data files, lists the variables
we are gathering, and includes links to some of the data sources.
* *Source inventory.xlsx:* This is a more complete list of the documents and 
reports we are using as data sources, including urls for where they are available
online.
* *Voulgaris dissertation.docx:* This is the full text of Dr Voulgaris's doctoral
dissertation, including all appendices. Chapter 2 includes a history of the
Capital Improvements Grants program and Chapter 7 includes an analysis of both
cost estimate accuracy and ridership forecast accuracy for a set of projects for
which data on cost estimates, ridership forecasts, observed ridership, and final
cost were available at the time (2017).
* *XCH notes on progress.txt* In 2022, Sue Chen was tasked with consolidating 
and checking the work of previous RAs who assisted with data assembly. These are 
her notes on the work she finished and the work that remained.

### project-data

The csv file "project-data-all.csv" should be a compilation of all the data
that is in the other five files.

The "Notes on spreadsheets" word document in the Notes and Background directory
is intended to explain the data in this file.

### project-data-srcs

The csv files in this file include codes to indicate the data sources for each 
piece of data in the project-data folder. Data source abbreviations are explained
in the "Notes on spreadsheets" word document in the Notes and Background directory.

### year-data

The csv file "year-data-all.csv" should be a compilation of all the data
that is in the other five files.

The "Notes on spreadsheets" word document in the Notes and Background directory
is intended to explain the data in this file.

### year-data-srcs

The csv files in this file include codes to indicate the data sources for each 
piece of data in the year-data folder. Data source abbreviations are explained
in the "Notes on spreadsheets" word document in the Notes and Background directory.
